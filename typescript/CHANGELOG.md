# Changelog

All notable changes to `@atlasent/sdk` are documented here. The SDK
follows [semver](https://semver.org/): breaking changes bump the major
(or minor while on 0.x).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-04-17

First stable release. Exports one `AtlaSentClient` with two methods
and one flat `AtlaSentError`.

### Added

- `AtlaSentClient.evaluate({ agent, action, context? })` — policy
  decision. Returns `{ decision: "ALLOW" | "DENY", permitId, reason,
  auditHash, timestamp }`. A clean `DENY` is **not** thrown.
- `AtlaSentClient.verifyPermit({ permitId, agent?, action?, context? })`
  — verify a previously-issued permit end-to-end.
- `AtlaSentError` with flat `{ status, code, requestId, retryAfterMs }`.
  `code` is one of `invalid_api_key | forbidden | rate_limited |
  timeout | network | bad_response | bad_request | server_error`.
- Native `fetch`, `AbortSignal.timeout`, `crypto.randomUUID` — zero
  runtime dependencies. Requires Node 20+.
- Standard headers on every request: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`,
  `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `User-Agent`, and a fresh per-request
  `X-Request-ID` for log correlation.
- Wire format: `POST /v1-evaluate` and `POST /v1-verify-permit`. Both
  share the JSON shape in `contract/schemas/`; drift is enforced in
  CI by `contract/tools/drift.py`.

### Tests

- 39 tests across `test/client.test.ts` (20), `test/errors.test.ts`
  (4), and `test/contract-vectors.test.ts` (15). The contract-vector
  suite replays the same golden wire inputs used by the Python SDK,
  guaranteeing cross-language parity.
